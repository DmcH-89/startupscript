# startupscript

Startup script for my Debian system.
If you want to use it for some reason instead of making your own - **think twice**. I give you **no warranty** it will work fine.
It supposed to run on apt distros without any graphical environment and login manager.

## Usage
Be root, —Ålone it, run it via 
``` 
  bash run.sh 
```
Wait for 2-10 minutes depending on how fast is your system.
